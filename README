This is a cython-powered wrapper around the C++/SGP4 library,
which is used to compute satellite positions from so-called
two-line elements (TLE).

The original SGP4lib was written by Daniel Warner <contact@danrw.com>

by Benjamin Winkel <bwinkel78@gmail.com> and is released under
GPL v3. Copies of both licenses should be contained in the
